# Audio Equalizer using MATLAB

Audio Equalizer developed in MATLAB for a final project in Digital Signal Processing at Faculty of Enginerring, Alexandria University.

## Overview
Our project focuses on the development of an advanced audio equalizer using MATLAB. The equalizer empowers users to customize their listening experience by adjusting the gain of specific frequency bands according to their preferences. By inputting a wave file, specifying gains for each frequency band, selecting a filter type (FIR or IIR), and setting the desired output sample rate, users can seamlessly tailor their audio output. Our program employs sophisticated filters, performs in-depth signal analysis, and provides comprehensive visualizations in both the time and frequency domains. Additionally, users can amplify the output signals, compare them with the original, and even play and save the modified wave file. With a user-friendly interface, this project offers a seamless and enjoyable audio equalization experience.

## Usage
1. Select the audio files to be manipulated
2. Enter the gain value for each of the bands
3. Enter the desired output sample rate
4. Choose what kind of filter you wish to use between FIR (Finite Impulse Response) and IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)
